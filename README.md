**Web-Based Radiology Information System with X-Ray Film Digitization**

**Overview**

This project is a web-based Radiology Information System (RIS) developed to streamline radiology department workflows, focusing on X-Ray film digitization. The system automates patient record management, report generation, and X-ray film digitization for seamless radiological data handling. The goal is to increase efficiency, reduce manual tasks, and improve accessibility of radiological images and records.

**Features**

Patient Management: Easily manage patient records, medical history.
X-Ray Film Digitization: Convert physical X-ray films into digital images, enabling quick access, storage, and retrieval.
Report Generation: Generate and store radiological reports based on the digitized films, including professional interpretations by radiologists.
Search and Filter: Efficiently search patient records, X-ray images, and reports.
Role-Based Access Control: Separate access levels for radiologists, technicians, and administrators to ensure data security.
Dashboard: Provides a quick view of reports.
Data Analytics: Generate reports on patient volumes, types of X-ray examinations, and other key metrics.

**Technology Stack**

Backend: PHP (Vanilla)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap), JavaScript
Database: MySQL (XAMMP)

**Purpose**

This system was developed as part of my thesis study to address the inefficiencies in traditional radiology workflows. By digitizing X-ray films and creating an accessible web-based platform, the system improves data accuracy, accessibility, and reporting time for medical practitioners and staff.

**Usage**

Log in using the appropriate role (radiologist, technician, admin).
Manage patient records and digitize X-ray films.
Generate, view, and store reports based on X-ray images.
Access reports and digital X-ray images anytime via the web-based platform.
Future Enhancements
AI-Based Image Analysis: Integrating AI to assist radiologists in interpreting X-ray images.
Cloud Storage: Store digitized X-ray films in cloud storage for easier access and scalability.
Mobile Version: Developing a mobile-friendly version of the system for greater accessibility.
